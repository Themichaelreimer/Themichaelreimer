# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mike. I'm a guy who often codes - sometimes for fun.
Apart from programming, I'm very interested in Math, Medicine and Music.

## Non-Work Projects in the works 

### Medistat.online
This project started during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the goal of collecting and displaying various medical statistics I was interested in. Today, it serves as a portfolio piece intended to demonstrate the following skills:
- Building CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions
- "Knowledge as Code" - Operations knowledge is encoded in easy to use scripts, so that anyone on a team can easily perform any action. In the past, these have also been excellent incidental timesavers in local environments. 
- Docker and Containerization
- Python / Django
- Javascript / Vue

### Terminal Adventure 
A randomly generated 2D adventure game in the vein of Legend of Zelda and console-based roguelikes. Collect progression items, fight the hordes, and descend into the depths to recover your lost wallet. First release is currently available and beatable. Second release with major graphical improvements is nearing completion.

### Super Misha Odessa
A closed source platformer I'm developing in Unity and C#. I'm keeping it closed source for the sake of the assets being used, and that I may want to sell this some day. I'm always happy to demo this though!

Kids: You got us Super Mario Odessey for Chirstmas!?
Me: Even better!
