# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mike. I'm a guy who often codes - sometimes for fun.
Apart from programming, I'm very interested in Math, Medicine and Music.

## Non-Work Projects in the works 

### Mortality Visualized
Django/Vue webapp for visualizing medical stats I find interesting. My long term goal with this is to start collecting stats via NLP.
MVP is finished, just have to launch the server and deal with CORS and CSRF. Should be live any day now

### PokemonLeague 
Pokemon inspired tactical RPG being written in Python/OpenGL via Pyglet. My main design goal for it is to make it as easily tweakable by the end user as possible. Creature stats, maps, attacks, sprites, and so on are stored in either plain text or easily and freely editable formats that you wouldn't need to be much of a wizard to modify.
