# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mike. I'm a guy who often codes - sometimes for fun.
Apart from programming, I'm very interested in Math, Medicine and Music.

## Non-Work Projects in the works 

### Mortality Visualized
Django/Vue webapp for visualizing medical stats I find interesting. My long term goals with this is to start collecting stats from medical papers via NLP, and to calculate probabilities of having diseases given sets of symptoms more accurately than the hilariously inaccurate WebMD system. https://medistat.online/

### Terminal Adventure 
A randomly generated 2D adventure game in the vein of Legend of Zelda and console-based roguelikes. Collect progression items, fight the hordes, and descend into the depths to recover your lost wallet. First release is currently available and beatable. Second release with major graphical improvements is nearing completion.
